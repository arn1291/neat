neuron innovations can be the same as hidden nodes from substrat

statistics 
    fitness over generation, best and all species

parallel execution

order genomes by fitness

        return self.fitness < other.fitness

Randomly connect one input to all hidden and output nodes (FS-NEAT)
Partial connected ... fraction
rtNEAT


### DONE

do not reset next_neuron_id in innovation when new genome is created
when adding neurons, create link innovations only if they are not exist
